# Public-Cryptography-System

This project uses implementations of one the most famous algorithms - `Diffie Hellman Key Generation` and `Newton Raphson Method` - in Cryptography. It uses the key generated by Diffie Hellman Algorithm in a defined function. Then it finds roots of the function to encode the message. Then it uses the same procedure to decrypt the `cipher text`.

## Development Environment

- You need to have `Python 3.10` install in your local system, along with appropriate versoin of `pip`.
- Clone this git repository into your local system
- Install the flask framework to host the server:
`pip install flask`
- Run `python3 app.py`
- Server is hosted at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
- In case your are getting error, try to kill all the services at `:5000`. Use `kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:8080)` to kill the port

## Result
- Following is result of out cryptography system<br />
